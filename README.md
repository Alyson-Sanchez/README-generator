# README-generator
This application generates a full README.md file, along with its associated license and badge based on user input. The generated file is then saved into their code editor, in my case it was VS code.

## Installation
Via this repository, the user must clone it into their local environment. Node.js must be installed.

## Usage
Once the file path is specified in the users terminal, they can type node index.js to run the application.

When the user is prompted for a license, the arrow keys can move the cursor up and down on the list, with 'No License' returning an empty string.

Afterwards, the title of your file will be asked for and automatically given the .md file type.
